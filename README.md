In school capstone for creating the website for St Albert Further Education

Worked on this project with a few other team members: Braeden Mayer and Sarah Pauluk

Sarah worked on designing and styling of most of the site, Braeden worked on creating most of the pages, and I worked on some of the more complex areas of looping through categories and displaying them as necassary.
